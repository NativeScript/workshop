## What is NativeScript?

Let’s take a look at what  NativeScript is using the slides linked to below.

### The NativeScript CLI

Now that you have the basics down, let’s look at how to actually build NativeScript apps.

<h4 class="exercise-start">
    <b>Exercise 1</b>: Creating an app
</h4>

Navigate to a folder you’d like to store apps in as you go through this workshop, and then run the following two commands.

```
tns create HelloWorld --ng
cd HelloWorld
```

<div class="exercise-end"></div>

<h4 class="exercise-start">
    <b>Exercise 2</b>: Running your app
</h4>

You use the `tns run` command to run NativeScript apps. If you’d like to complete this workshop on iOS, run the following command.

```
tns run ios
```

And if you’d like to complete this workshop on Android, run the following command instead.

```
tns run android
```

<div class="exercise-end"></div>

<h4 class="exercise-start">
    <b>Exercise 3</b>: Making some changes
</h4>

Open your `app/item/item.component.html` file and change the `title` attribute of the `<ActionBar>`.

<div class="exercise-end"></div>

### Debugging NativeScript apps

Together we’ll go through [the instructions to debug NativeScript apps in Visual Studio Code](https://docs.nativescript.org/tooling/visual-studio-code-extension#debugging).
