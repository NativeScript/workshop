# NativeScript Workshop

In this repo you’ll find material for holding NativeScript workshops.

## Instructions

Found a problem in [this workshop’s instructions](https://nativescript.github.io/workshop/)? The instructions live in this repo’s `docs/chapters` folder. The `docs` folder is a Jekyll site, so you can run it locally with the following commands (assuming you have [Jekyll installed](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)):

```
cd docs
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Alternatively just send a pull request with any content changes and we can figure it out.
