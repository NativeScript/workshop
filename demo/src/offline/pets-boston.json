He's great with older kids ands adults and would be a GREAT hiking partner.  He is fully vetted and ready for his new home with you.\n\nAdoptions for adult dogs is $100 and for Pups and pure bred, $150.  The fee is waved when you live in the states and you pay for transport.\n\nPlease email  amigosdelosanimalespr@mail.com for more information and an application!\n\nWhat is a Sato you might ask?\n\nA Sato is a street dog from Puerto Rico. No two Satos look exactly alike and they all have unique stories, but despite their often rough start in life, Satos are some of the best rescue dogs out there (in our opinion anyway, maybe we are a little biased!) They are the most lovable dogs you will ever rescue and one thing we do know for sure about Satos, people who have adopted Satos LOVE them and agree with us, Satos are the best!!"

I am a 4 year old red nose pitte that loves meeting new people. I am good with other dogs. I like car rides, especially to McDonalds to get a cheeseburger! I am happy playing or just hanging out watching a movie. I could also be someoneâ\u0080\u0099s hiking buddy or hang out at the local dog park, as I am active, but not hyper. I donâ\u0080\u0099t bark a lot. I love to play, but can be a very mellow dog when I get some lovin. I love to snuggle!\n\nSo what is my story? I was found wondering the streets of Houston, Texas, crying and alone.  I was so hungry and tired, that I just ran into a garage one day looking for some help. I was starving, skin and bones. The pounds are full here, and not alot of dogs make it out alive. I was blessed to be saved off the cold cruel streets by a good Samaritan. I know have a full belly each night and someone to keep me safe. I know I can make someone very happy and I still have a bright future. Can you give me another chance at a forever home? I promise to be a good boy!\n\nIf you are interested, please call or text my Uncle Greg at 713 962 6635 or email him at greg.carraway@yahoo.com.

I am 2 years old and I love meeting new people I dont meet a stranger and I am good with kids. I even know a few tricks like sit and shake. See my video! I am happy playing or just hanging out watching a movie. I could also be someoneâ\u0080\u0099s hiking buddy or hang out at the local dog park, as I am active, but not hyper. I am a very mellow dog when I get some lovin! \n\nSo what is my story? I was found on the streets of  Houston, crying and alone. I was blessed to be saved off the cold cruel streets by a good Samaritan. They took me to a locat vet and got me all my shots.  I now have a full belly each night and someone to keep me safe. I know I can make someone very happy and I still have a bright future. Can you give me another chance at a forever home? I promise to be a good boy!\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are interested, please email Uncle Greg at greg.carraway@yahoo.com.

            "$t": "Hi everyone â\u0080\u0093 my name is Riley.  Pleased to meet you!\n\nIâ\u0080\u0099m a 10-year old, handsome male Brittany  mix and Iâ\u0080\u0099m looking for a new home to settle into.  My previous owner died and I was left with people that didnâ\u0080\u0099t really want me.  This eventually led me to a shelter.  Going through all those changes has made me a little cautious when meeting new people.  Iâ\u0080\u0099m looking for a family who is older and understands change is unsettling. \n\nMy foster family says Iâ\u0080\u0099m a good companion and have come a long way in a short period of time.  Iâ\u0080\u0099m a medium energy dog that loves a good lap and am nice to be around.   As a 10-year old I come with good behavior skills.  Iâ\u0080\u0099m house trained, an awesome sleeper at night, sit patiently by the door to go out, understand the word â\u0080\u0098noâ\u0080\u0099, can sit, crate trained (you know, the usual).  I do bark to announce those who enter the house and to warn of a strange noise.\n\nI love walks and am good on a leash.  Iâ\u0080\u0099m a nose to the ground kind of guy and will pull a little when I pick up a scent, but can be settled easily.  Iâ\u0080\u0099m respectful of fences and would love a yard to sniff around.  \n\nIâ\u0080\u0099m neutered, up to date with vaccinations, heartworm negative and on prevention. If you would like to learn more about me, I know my foster mom would be happy to chat with you. To get started, please fill out an adoption application at the New England Brittany Rescue website, www.nebrittanyrescue.org. We look forward to hearing from you."

            "$t": "RIVER\nRiver is a  gorgeous  one-year-old 45 pound  pointer mix.  He is a gentle sweet boy who will make a very dedicated companion. He still has his puppy-ish  happiness and playfulness, but he is not hyper.   He loves nothing better than to get out on a leash and explore. He would gladly be your jogging or hiking companion.   He would also make a great playmate for another dog.    He will make a wonderful and loyal companion for some lucky individual or family. \nLocated in  HOUSTON TX\n\nADOPTION FEE:  $395 includes all his vetting-neutered, all shots, dewormed, HW test negative, microchip, and health certificate.   That fee also includes his transport to your state.   Will use a transport company which is run by fellow rescuers  so the dogs are in very good hands along the way.\n\nINQUIRIES:  call or text Jeanie Royal at 832-495-1719.

He would love to be the happy hiker at your side for long walks, hiking or even jogging.  With his big heart, he has lots of love to give to some lucky individual or family.\nLocated in HOUSTON TEXAS\n\nINQUIRIES:  call  or text my Uncle Greg at 713 962 6635 or email him at greg.carraway@yahoo.com.

            "$t": "Brisco is a 7 year old Brittany Spaniel.   He is orange and white, with a little heart right on top of his head.  Brisco is on the larger side - weighing in at 75 pounds and is about 3 feet tall.  He is completely up to date with his vaccinations, he has flea and tick prevention and is on heart worm medication.     Brisco is a love bug!   He is sedate and very quiet (in 4 years he has barked maybe 10 times - usually at wild animals).    He loves a good walk but is content to lay on the couch most of the day.  He is not aggressive and has a sweet temperament.  He is very curious and food motivated so you have to be sure to watch your trash can!   He is housebroken and crate trained (we only crate him when we are out of the home).     Unfortunately, Brisco recently (and suddenly) lost his vision to SARDS (sudden acquired retinal degeneration syndrome).   This is a permanent condition.  Sadly, our home, which is a split-level and has stairs to get in and out, is no longer the best place for him.    Despite our constant efforts to assist Brisco navigating the stairs, he has developed anxiety.    We also have 3 young children who constantly leave things in his path, and leave cabinets and drawers open, which make it difficult for Brisco to navigate.    \n \nBrisco has been a loved member of our family for 4 years.   The decision to look for a more suitable home for Brisco is heartbreaking, but we need to do what is best for him.   The perfect home for Brisco is one that has no more than 3 stairs to get in and out (he has no problem navigating the outside stairs), does not have young children, does not have a cat.   Brisco is compatible with like dogs - meaning not hyperactive or aggressive.  Also, I am a stay at home mom so Brisco isn't used to being alone for long periods (exceeding 5 hours). \nIf you are interested in adopting this very special boy, please  fill out an adoption application at the New England Brittany Rescue website, www.nebrittanyrescue.org. We look forward to hearing from you."

            "$t": "Sadie is a beautiful Brittany mix.  She is approximately 3 years old and is a very active girl.  She enjoys going on her walks, and is very alert when a squirrel crosses her path.  Sadie enjoys watching for them through the window too. She is house broken and crate trained but is not always fond of going in her crate so her foster mom makes sure there are plenty of toys in there with her.  She loves to have a toy in her mouth as she runs through the house.  Sadie is very energetic and athletic as she jumps up on doors to look out the window.  Sadie is learning commands, and is is good at \"sit.\" However, continued  training would server her well as she is quite a puller on the leash.  Sadie needs lots of activity so going to the dog park or a place where she can run would be most welcome.\nSadie has been spayed, is up to date with her vaccinations, is heartworm negative and on prevention and is microchipped as well. \n If you are interested in adopting this sweet girl, please fill out an adoption application at the New England Brittany Rescue website, www.nebrittanyrescue.org. We look forward to hearing from you."
